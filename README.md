# EU-wide-Registry-of-Semantic-Models

This is the GitHub repository for the EU-wide registry for semantic assets.

Together with the working group, we aim to create a registry which would facilitate the discoverability of semantic models across Member States.

On this repository, documentation about each workshop and the slides used could be found, together with the presentations given during the pre-conference workshops as background information.

Any problems encountered, suggestions or feedback can be submitted as issues in the issue tab of this repository.

If you would want to be part of the next workshop, do not hesitate to contact us and an invitation for the next meeting would be sent out to you.
